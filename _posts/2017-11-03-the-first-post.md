This post is to test the eligible of static pages using `jekyll` toolkit.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  print "Hi", name

print_hi('Tom')
# prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
