My R&D Interests lie in Text Mining for almost a decade. I have published some papers on academic conferences and journals like SIGIR, CIKM, KDD, WWW, ICDM and TKDE. I have also developed an award-winning system for mining events from social media. Currently I'm working on a project of public opinion analysis in McGill university. My major programming languages are Java and Python, although have been playing with other languages like Matlab, Objective-C, Go etc. from time to time.
